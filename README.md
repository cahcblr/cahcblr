## Welcome to the Center for Ancient History and Culture

The Center for Ancient History and Culture (CAHC) carries out inter-disciplinary research on India's ancient cultural & intellectual heritage.

Generally, Indian history is treated as chronicling political history, without insights into cultural and social issues.Ancient Indian history is still depicted from a Eurocentric viewpoint. There is a need to present ancient history in a dispassionate and objective fashion avoiding extremities of ideologies. The modern education should be able to connect with intellectual traditions deep rooted in ancient India. CAHC was started in the year 2011 to conduct primary research towards addressing this gap. 

The Centre studies natural sciences in ancient texts and unpublished manuscripts. In the area of Pre-Siddhantic astronomy of India “Parāśaratantra”, an ancient Sanskrit text on astronomy & natural sciences was brought out in 2013 with text, translation, and notes. Naradashilpa a little known Sanskrit work on Architectural Engineering will be released very soon. Study of Vrddha-Gargiya-Jyotisha an ancient text on observational astronomy is currently under progress supported by ICHR.
